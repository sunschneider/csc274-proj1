three-coloring triangulated polygon
## files
**polygon_triangulate.py**-a copy of python code for triangulating a polygon by Joe Burkhardt at FSU (https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/polygon_triangulate/polygon_triangulate.html)  
**tricolor.py**-my functions, used to tricolor a polygon using a greedy algorithm, which works here because the dual graph of a triangulation is a tree and a function to calculate the minimum number of "guards" needed based on the colored polygon  
**main.py**-usage examples of my functions on two polygons  
**explaination.pdf**-more detailed documentation
## functions
### tricolorize(n, x, y)  
**inputs**-n, the number of sides on the polygon; x, an array of x coordinates of the vertices; and y, an array of y cooridinates of the vertices. NOTE: points need to be in counterclockwise order for triangulation to work   
**output**-returns a list of vertices with their corresponding colors (marked as 0, 1, and 2) as a dict  
**description**-triangulates the given polygon (using Burkhardt's code) and uses a greedy algorithm to color the vertices starting with the last triangle generated by the triangulate function  
### colored triangles(n, x, y)
**inputs**-n, the number of sides on the polygon; x, an array of x coordinates of the vertices; and y, an array of y cooridinates of the vertices. NOTE: points need to be in counterclockwise order for triangulation to work  
**output**-returns an array of three value arrays representing triangles, with each value representing a colored vertex   
**description**-triangulates and colors polygon (see tricolorize) and then "paints" colors onto corresponding vertices. mostly just used to check that the function properly colored the vertices (i.e. that each triangle has all 3 colors)  
### minguards(n, x, y)
**inputs**-n, the number of sides on the polygon; x, an array of x coordinates of the vertices; and y, an array of y cooridinates of the vertices. NOTE: points need to be in counterclockwise order for triangulation to work  
**output**-a single int, representing the minimum number of guards needed to guard a polygon with n sides in the Art Gallery theorem, based on Steve Fisk's Short proof, note that this is not necesarily the optimal amount for the given polygon, but is always sufficient.  
**description**-triangulates and colors the polygon (see tricolorize) then finds the color with the lowest number of vertices and returns that number
